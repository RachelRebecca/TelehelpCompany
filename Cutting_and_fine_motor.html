<h1>Puzzle</h1>
<p>
    The point of this activity is to improve a child's fine motor skills using puzzle pieces. To add the cutting element,
    you can have your child create the puzzle. For example, you can take the front side of a cereal box and have your child
    cut it into a puzzle. Your child can wrap these "puzzle pieces," or real puzzle pieces if you prefer, in aluminum foil
    and then unwrap the pieces for an amazing finger exercise. Lastly, the child will then be able to put the puzzle together.
    For a more intensive sensory experience, your child could try laying on his or her stomach on the floor while completing
    the puzzle.

<h1>Paper</h1>
<p>
    The point of this activity is to combine fine motor with cutting, using paper as a medium. Step one would be to draw
    lines on paper to make strips. Have your child cut the strips out, and then use the strips to make shapes, like a square,
    a triangle, or a plus sign. You can also draw shapes that your child can cut out, and assemble into a design. For example,
    a square and a triangle shape could form a house. To turn this into an arts and crafts activity, you can have your child
    glue these pieces down, or for a greater fine motor activity, your child can then fold, crease, tear, crumple, flick,
    and throw the strips of paper he or she made. An even greater plus is that you can then have your child throw these
    crumpled pieces of paper into the wastebasket, improving eye-hand coordination as well as the cleanliness of your house.

<h1>Playdough</h1>
<p>
The goal of this activity is to improve fine motor, finger dexterity and cutting skills, through the use of playdough.
    Your child would roll the playdough using both hands into a long strip. He or she would then cut the playdough into
    four or five pieces, using scissors. Then, the child can roll each piece into a ball between his hands. For further
    play, your child would use a fork to spear these pieces, and put them back into the container. You could form the pieces
    into shapes or letters. Lastly, you can pinch, squeeze, twist, flick, or roll the playdough for additional fine motor.
