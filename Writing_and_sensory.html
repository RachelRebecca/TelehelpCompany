<h1 >Sensory Bins</h1>
    <p>The point of the sensory bin is to play with objects of different textures. To make a sensory bin, crush everyday
        objects like cheerios and graham crackers to create a substance that resembles sand, which is collected into a bin.
       The child can play in this "sand" bin. Other things you can include in the sensory bin are dry pasta, beans, rice,
        cooked pasta, and mashed potatoes. When all of this is inside the bin, you can add toys into the bin as well, and
        have your child hunt for the "treasure." Your child could write letters inside the sensory bins, tracing letters
        in the "sand" or other objects. For an additional sensory element, you can have your child clean the toys found
        in the sensory bins using a sponge with warm water and soap.

<h1>Food</h1>
    <p>The point of this activity is to use food to make letters and shapes. Food like cheerios, croutons, chocolate chips,
        cut-up vegetables, thin pretzels rods, and marshmallows can be used to teach your child how to write. With young kids,
        you would trace a shape on paper, like a plus sign, circle, square, or triangle, and have them place the food on
        top of that shape. With older kids, you would do the same with letters. With less solid foods like whipped cream
        or mashed potatoes, you could have your child use his or her fingers to trace the shape or letters through them.
        Another activity can be to form shapes out of toothpicks and marshmallows, as shown in the picture. The marshmallow
        holds the toothpicks together and so one can form many shapes with them. An oral sensory activity that incorporates
        food is to have your child taste different foods of different textures and temperatures.</p>

<img id="Movement" src="../TelehelpCompany/Images/movement_vertical.jpeg" width="25%" alt="Movement"/>
<h1>Movement</h1>
<p> The point of this activity is to use your whole body to learn the skill of writing. The example shown in the picture
    depicts using arms or scarves to write letters in the air. One can also use painter's tape to form shapes or letters
    on the floor, and then have the child jump, run, or walk on the letter or shape. Additionally, one can put the painter's
    tape on the wall in shapes or letters and have the child trace them on the wall or hit a ball on the letter or shape
    you select. This is a fun way to get kids to learn the letters using their whole body and several sensory systems at
    the same time.</p>
